**Author:** Duy Duc Vo (Frank) 
**Platform:** [TunePad](https://tunepad.com)  
**Language:** Python 

## Overview  
CodeBeat Vinahouse is a musical composition prototype created using the TunePad platform and Python.  
The project explores how code can act as a creative medium for generating rhythm, melody, and structure—specifically within the Vinahouse genre, a popular form of Vietnamese electronic dance music. The work demonstrates algorithmic music creation through loops, functions, and iterative pattern design. The final prototype runs approximately **40 seconds**, layering percussion, bass, and rhythmic melodies into an energetic, club-inspired track.

## Project Structure  
| Track | Instrument | Description |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **Kick Drums** | Drums | Core rhythm pattern simulating continuous 4/4 beats. |
| **Claps (1st Half)** | Drums | Mid-range percussion adding punch and rhythm. |
| **Hats (1st Half)** | Drumkit | High-frequency texture creating rhythmic contrast. |
| **Bass 1 & Bass 2** | Bass | Foundational melodic line developed through repetition and looping. |
| **2nd Half Melody Bass** | Bass | Introduces new rhythmic and tonal variety. |
| **2nd Half Support Bass** | Bass | Reinforces harmony and rhythmic stability. |
| **2nd Half Claps** | Drums | More complex rhythmic phrasing through variable rests. |
| **2nd Half Hats** | Drumkit | Alternating rests for syncopated drive. |

## Design and Development Insights
The project was developed through three main stages:
1. Setup & Rhythm Creation – Building foundational kick, clap, and hat layers.
2. Melody Integration – Using Python functions to generate repeating bass patterns.
3. Refinement & Testing – Adjusting beat timing, layering volumes, and controlling playback transitions.
**Creative Problem-Solving:**
TunePad’s auto-looping system posed a challenge for defining song boundaries.
A workaround using rest(beats=120) was implemented to insert silence and prevent immediate looping, allowing the composition to “breathe” between sections.

## Limitations and Future Improvements 
**Limitations:**
1. TunePad’s limited instrument library and lack of Vinahouse-style effects.
2. Auto-looping made precise section transitions challenging.
**Future Work:**
1. Extend the track to full length (2–3 minutes).
2. Use conditional statements for tempo and variation.

## Learning Outcomes
Through CodeBeat Vinahouse, I developed:
1. Programming skills using loops, functions, and timing control.
2. Musical literacy in rhythm, timing, and structure.
3. An understanding of creative coding.
